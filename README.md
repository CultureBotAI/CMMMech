# CMMMech

An evidence-backed knowledge base for **critical minerals and materials**, with
**microbial extraction, transformation, and recovery mechanisms** alongside
their wider resource and material context.

The knowledge base provides a LinkML schema, an offline strict validator,
tests, CI, and three primary-literature pilot records. Each record has a
timestamped scientific review; synthetic test fixtures remain separate.

| Element record | Curated microbial mechanism | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| [Cobalt](data/records/cobalt.yaml) | Acidophilic consortium bioleaching of spent-battery black mass | Laboratory solubilization, not isolated cobalt product |
| [Neodymium](data/records/neodymium.yaml) | Biosorption by dried *Chlorella vulgaris* biomass | Chemically pretreated magnet leachate; inactive biomass |
| [Palladium](data/records/palladium.yaml) | Resting *Desulfovibrio desulfuricans* cells reduce Pd(II) | Defined soluble salt assay; hydrogenase causality remains inferred |

These are element records. Experimental salts, alloys and secondary resources
are specified in mechanism context, not equated with mineral species. See the
[pilot assessment](docs/pilot-session.md) and [record reviews](reviews/records/).

## Scope

- Distinguish elements, mineral species, mineral groups, commodities, and
  secondary resources rather than treating those as synonyms.
- Record criticality by jurisdiction, list name, and edition, with a source.
  There is no universal or timeless `is_critical` flag.
- Represent mechanisms such as bioleaching, biosorption, biomineralization,
  redox transformation, separation, recovery, and recycling.
- Mark microbial involvement explicitly; connect identified organisms and
  experimental context to evidence for the particular mechanism.
- Preserve uncertainty and evidence that supports, partially supports, or
  contradicts a mechanism. Validation is not scientific verification.

## Local Checks

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --locked
just check
uv run cmmmech validate
uv run cmmmech validate path/to/record.yaml
uv run cmmmech validate --require-records
```

Without `just`, use `uv run python scripts/check.py`. The same command is used
by CI. No research provider, model, credential, or network lookup is used by
the checks after dependencies are installed.

Each record belongs in `data/records/<slug>.yaml`. See
[the record guide](docs/records.md) and the packaged
[LinkML schema](src/cmmmech/schema/cmmmech.yaml). Validation rejects unknown
fields, duplicate YAML keys, malformed references, dangling source references,
and duplicate record identifiers. An empty corpus is reported explicitly;
`--require-records` makes it an error. The shared local/CI gate now uses this
flag so accidental loss of the whole corpus fails `just check`.

Use the local [record-review skill](.claude/skills/review-record/SKILL.md) for
new or changed scientific records. Review artifacts identify the reviewed
commit and working changes, hash the record bytes, and retain unresolved limits.

## Sources

Use the local [source-discovery skill](.claude/skills/cmmmech-discover-sources/SKILL.md)
to investigate CMM data sources, reassess known sources, or identify coverage gaps.
It produces a dated search log, source assessment and ranked curation handoff under
`research/sources/`, keeping discovery leads separate from verified evidence.

Criticality is a designation made by a named authority at a particular time.
Useful discovery sources include the [USGS critical-minerals programme](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/about-2025-list-critical-minerals)
and the [EU critical raw materials overview](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/the-critical-raw-materials-act/).
These are entry points, not imported datasets or an endorsement of a frozen list.
Curate microbial mechanisms from the underlying research, preserving organism,
substrate, conditions, and the distinction between laboratory results and field
or industrial deployment.

## Integration Status

CLAW fleet registration, canonical shared/history schemas and adapters,
vendored governance, PR shepherd, and native merge-queue configuration are
**pending**. Nothing in this bootstrap claims those are deployed. Admission
requires a separate CLAW change and coordinated governing release; do not invent
a vendored pin or silently copy a different Mech's capabilities.

The included CI handles pull requests, pushes to `main`, and `merge_group`
events, but a workflow alone does not enable a remote merge queue.
The [dated integration audit](docs/integration-status.md) verifies the pending
status and gives concrete follow-up work through CLAW's supported admission process.
